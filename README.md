HAT is a TypeScript library that provides a variety of useful functions and algorithms for working with arrays. Whether you need to manipulate, filter, transform, or sort arrays, HAT has you covered. HAT is designed to be easy to use, fast, and reliable. You can install HAT using npm or yarn, and import it in your TypeScript projects.

Some of the features of HAT include:

- Helper functions for waiting, random choice, and more!
- Functional programming style methods for mapping, reducing, filtering, and finding elements in arrays
- A collection of sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort
- A custom type definition for arrays that supports generics and optional parameters


## To Install
```bash
npm i -d @porkyproductions/hat
```

HAT is inspired by the cute and spiky hedgehogs that love to curl up into balls, and inspired the namesake of PorkyProductions. We hope you enjoy using HAT as much as we do!
